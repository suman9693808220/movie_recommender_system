Movie Recommendation System

Introduction:
Welcome to our Movie Recommendation System! Our system is designed to help users discover new movies tailored to their preferences. Whether you're a movie enthusiast or just looking for something to watch, our system aims to provide personalized recommendations to enhance your movie-watching experience.

How It Works:
Our movie recommendation system utilizes a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to suggest movies to users. Here's a brief overview of each approach:

Collaborative Filtering: This technique recommends movies based on the preferences of users with similar tastes. By analyzing user ratings and interactions, the system identifies patterns and suggests movies that similar users have enjoyed.
Content-Based Filtering: This technique recommends movies based on their attributes, such as genre, actors, directors, and plot keywords. By understanding the characteristics of movies that a user has liked in the past, the system suggests other movies with similar attributes.
